# SpineCodex Version Identities

SpineCodex carries two intentionally separate version identities:

- The product version is the workspace package version. It is used by npm
  packages, GitHub release tags, update checks, and product telemetry. The
  current product version is `0.4.1`.
- The Codex compatibility version is the upstream client baseline used by
  protocol-facing requests. It is recorded in
  `[workspace.metadata.spinecodex]` in `codex-rs/Cargo.toml` and mirrored into
  runtime distribution metadata. The current baseline is `0.153.4`, tag
  `rust-v0.153.4`, commit
  `3d2ee51ca2d5db578f328aa75e20aa22c0197c9a`.

The public `--version` flags, including `codex --version` and
`codex exec --version`, report the Codex compatibility version so a
SpineCodex binary identifies the Codex base it was built from. SpineCodex
release artifacts retain the independent product version in package and
release metadata.

The compatibility version is used for the server-visible Codex identity in:

- the `/models?client_version=...` query and its cache identity;
- the `codex_cli_rs/<version>` User-Agent prefix;
- the built-in OpenAI provider `version` request header; and
- App Server initialize responses sent to external clients that implement the
  official upstream Codex app-server contract.

The App Server daemon is the sole initialize exception. It parses the response
User-Agent as the running SpineCodex product version and compares that value
with the managed binary's MCP `initialize` `serverInfo.version`, so both
probes receive the product identity. This protocol is also available in legacy
Spine binaries and does not confuse public CLI compatibility output with the product. MCP and other local product identities also continue to use the
product version.

In code, `get_codex_product_user_agent()` is product-facing and
`get_codex_compat_user_agent()` is used by upstream Codex compatibility
surfaces, including remote Codex/OpenAI HTTP requests and external App Server
clients. Keep these call sites explicit when adding a new integration.

Other Cargo-version consumers remain product-facing unless a protocol contract
explicitly classifies them as compatibility fields. Do not change the
workspace package version to follow an upstream rebase: that would change the
SpineCodex release identity and make the subscription backend evaluate the
product version as an upstream Codex client version.

When rebasing on upstream Codex, update the three metadata values together and
run the focused provider, models-manager, login, and protocol checks. A remote
`requires a newer version of Codex` response means a server-visible
compatibility field is stale; it is not evidence that npm or GitHub product
versioning should be changed.
