# Spine feedback

SpineCodex uses a separate `/feedback` flow when the current thread has
SpineJIT or SpineSpawn enabled. If neither feature is enabled, `/feedback`
keeps the Base Codex category, log-consent, and upload flow unchanged.

The Spine feedback form accepts:

- An optional note of at most 8,192 UTF-8 bytes. Leading and trailing
  whitespace is trimmed; the remaining text is sent as entered and is not
  redacted.
- Zero to three screenshots.
- An explicit confirmation before anything is sent.

## Rollout debug attachment

Every Spine feedback report contains one `rollout-debug.jsonl.gz`. It covers
the current thread and every recursively spawned descendant known when the
request starts. There is no separate business child-count limit; the package
resource budgets below apply to the complete subtree snapshot. A child created
after that snapshot belongs to a later report.

The attachment retains diagnostic structure:

- record and thread order;
- Spine control argument shape and typed outcome;
- compact boundaries and token usage;
- package-local IDs that preserve equality only inside the attachment.

It removes conversation text, model output, tool bodies, summaries, memories,
raw thread and call IDs, paths, and URLs. Unknown, malformed, or over-8 MiB
source lines remain in their original positions as redacted placeholders.
Raw rollouts and generic logs are not attached.

Attachment generation has fixed resource budgets:

- 65,536 JSON structure nodes per source record and 4,194,304 per package;
- 131,072 subtree thread identifiers, 256 MiB of captured rollout source
  bytes, and 131,072 source records;
- 131,072 package-local ID mappings using at most 8 MiB of retained ID bytes;
- 32,768 pending tool calls.

If any budget is exhausted, attachment generation rejects the complete
package. SpineCodex does not send a truncated or partial debug package.
On a platform where the collector cannot verify a reopened rollout file with a
stable file identity, attachment generation also fails closed.

This file is observational diagnostic evidence. It cannot replay a session,
restore Spine state, or recover the removed content.

## Screenshots

The form accepts PNG, JPEG, and static WebP images. Animated WebP and other
formats are rejected. Image pixels are decoded and encoded as new PNG files
in both the client and the app server, so source metadata, paths, and
filenames are not sent.

Screenshot pixels are **not redacted**. Source code, terminal text, paths,
account details, and secrets visible in a screenshot remain visible in the
uploaded pixels. Review every screenshot before confirming the report.

Limits:

- At most three screenshots.
- At most 8,192 pixels on either side and 16 megapixels per image.
- At most 5 MiB per encoded PNG and 10 MiB for all screenshots.
- At most 20 MiB for all report attachments.
- At most 20 MiB for each encoded image source read by the client.

## Destination and report ID

After confirmation, SpineCodex sends the report directly to the
`spinecodex / spine-codex-feedback` Sentry project in Sentry's EU data region.
The application reports success only after the ingest endpoint returns HTTP
2xx, then displays the 32-character Sentry report ID.

An HTTP 2xx response means that Sentry accepted the inbound envelope. It does
not guarantee that indexing has completed or that the event or its attachments
will be retained for a particular duration. Retention follows the Sentry
organization and project policy in effect at the time of submission.
